Easy Sign-Up & Login: Users sign up or log in with email/password. After signing up, they’re automatically taken to the right place based on their role.

Auto-generate test papers from your question bank (or AI) with a chosen total score.

QCTO Tools:

Learner View:

Once logged in, learners can view the assessments appropriate for them in a single dashboard.

Every page is protected so only the right roles can access it, and everything ties back to a clear “role → dashboard” redirect.
