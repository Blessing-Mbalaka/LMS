Criteria based inspection plans are created to meet specific regulatory requirements and workflows, depending upon where the product is in the manufacturing lifecycle. Online visibility and real-time tracking of incoming raw materials, parts, and subassemblies are critical to successful inspections. An effective quality management solution can manage all the information related to inspections, and thus deliver a unified view of inspection criteria and results to key company personnel.</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Discuss the 10 industry needs to perform testing / inspection for either a service or a product.</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>10</td></tr></table><h3>1.1.3</h3><p>1.1.3 Complete a testing checklist for a product or service across all processes (input, inline and endline)</p><p>(10 Marks)</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>1.1.3 Case StudyAllocate ten mark for number 1 Use discretion to allocate marks for any other relevant point that may be given by the student.</td></tr></table><p>Case Study:</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Limit Sample</td><td>Master Sample</td></tr><tr><td>Limit sample is the reference sample of testing and inspection</td><td>It is the reference sample of production</td></tr><tr><td>It is approved by customer quality person</td><td>It is approved by customer engineering.</td></tr><tr><td>It allows permissible visual inspection variation without affecting part quality</td><td>It does not allow permissible visual inspection beyond design</td></tr><tr><td>It does not fulfil the customer specific requirements.</td><td>It fulfils the specific customer requirements.</td></tr><tr><td>Looking at the 2 scenarios above for the Limit Sample and the Master Sample, create 2 testing checklists for a service or a product which will ensure that the two samples meets customer requirements.</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>10</td></tr></table><h3>1.1.4</h3><p>1.1.4 Continuously inspect and test input, inline and endline to prevent non-conformance and make recommendations.</p><p>(15 Marks)</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>1.1.4 Case Study Allocate fifteen Marks for number 1Use discretion to allocate marks for any other relevant point that may be given by the student.</td></tr></table><p>Case Study:</p><p>In order to establish why a process/product/service is not conforming to the standard, one needs to do a root cause analysis and make recommendation to prevent occurrence.
